<h2 id="mistakes-were-made">Mistakes were made</h2>

<p>Using application state, or global state, is <em>not</em> the right answer for developing front-end components.</p>

<p>The draw of application state is the creation of a <em>definitive</em> single-source of truth from which our entire app’s state can be determined. Then, this <em>definitive</em> state becomes the one and <em>only</em> place where you need to <em>query</em> state. And because it is ubiquitous, adding a new shared property becomes extremely simple; add it once, and it’s available everywhere.</p>

<p>This ease of modification is, unfortunately, double-edged. I’ve noticed two messy patterns arise once global state is available.</p>

<h3 id="there-is-no-local-everything-is-global">There is no <em>local</em>; everything is <em>global</em></h3>

<p>The lure of global state is such that once it is implemented, it has a tendency to <em>supplant</em> local state management. Simple UI changes that could have been implemented as local state changes creep into global state because their values <em>could</em> be used to affect other components in <em>cool</em> ways.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example of this: On <em>Turaku</em> (my <em>late</em> pet password manager project), editing the title of any <em>entry</em> using the <em>editor</em> component changes the title of the entry in the <em>entries list</em> component immediately. This was extremely easy to implement because the two components shared the data about entries via the application state.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/harigopal/image/upload/v1541686088/blog/201910/turaku-editing-entry-title.gif" alt="Editing title of an entry in Turaku" /></p>

<p>The drawback is that even though the responsibility for <em>changing</em> an entry lies logically with the editor component, something as simple as <em>saving</em> changes becomes a sticky proposition. Questions arise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if the user clicks on another entry in the list when one has unsaved changes? Sure, the unsaved changes would persist - they’re in app state, but the old editor would be unmounted eventually…</li>
  <li>So which part of the UI should the user interact with to initiate the save?</li>
  <li>Maybe we should auto-save if the editor un-mounts as a result of user switching to another view..? But which part of the UI would show that there is a network operation on-going? What happens if the network operation fails?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last option is what I went with, and I never answered all of the questions fully. I just slapped a few chunks of code together to get everything working, and promised myself that I would get around to cleaning it up eventually.</p>

<p>This was me ignoring the <em>KISS</em> principle.</p>

<p>The <em>simple</em> solution here would have been to isolate the <em>edited</em> state of an entry to the component that <em>does</em> the editing - the editor, and communicate changes to higher-level components only once those changes were persisted. A simple UI curtain could have been employed to ensure that users couldn’t interact with unrelated parts of the UI while the edit was in progress.</p>

<p>What should have been simple - making a few edits to an entry, and then saving it ended up involving <em>many</em> different components, and is now  unnecessarily complicated because I couldn’t say “No” to a few cool things.</p>

<h3 id="application-state-is-god-all-responsibilities-are-centralised">Application state is god; all responsibilities are centralised</h3>

<p>I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP</a> is more of a <em>guideline</em> than a <em>rule</em> when it comes to writing applications, but by its very nature, application state seems <em>require</em> that SRP be <em>broken</em>.</p>

<p>When we collect state from different parts of the application, it’s almost impossible for all of these values to be (closely) related. Usually, they’re collected over time as the application’s feature-set expands and evolves, and as such they’re going to be incorporated into a single reducer that, increasingly needs to handle values with different purposes.</p>

<p>The issue that pops up as a result is increased <em>cognitive load</em>. It’s easy to make changes when the number of things that <em>can</em> change is low. The larger the size of the state being managed by a reducer, the harder it is to simply fit all of its variables into <em>our</em> working memory.</p>

<p>When asked for his opinion, here’s what <a href="http://www.jasimabasheer.com/">Jasim</a> had to say about this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One solution to large reducers that we’ve been using more and more is to lean on domain-specific modules, and use the reducer just as a very high-level dispatcher.</p>

  <p>UI handler functions in lower-level components can run their own computation and then pass final results back to a reducer. This keeps the responsibility of each domain closer to the component that handles it, and the implementations are all co-located neatly in their own modules.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="back-to-basics">Back to Basics</h2>

<p>When reaching for global / application state as a solution from our toolbox, its critical to examine whether it’s worth the costs involved, and whether we’re being careful to avoid the pitfalls that it exposes.</p>

<p>State-management based on localized state with plentiful prop drilling might not be <em>stylish</em>, but it’s based on sound development practises, works <em>really</em> well in most situations, and should be the default choice for React and ReasonReact applications of any level of complexity.</p>

<p>As for my pet project, it’s future is uncertain. I started working on it when I was still a beginner with ReasonML, and the mistakes I made while learning have piled up. Its state management is, quite frankly, a mess. However, thanks to those mistakes, by the time I introduced ReasonML &amp; ReasonReact to my full-time work, I knew enough to be conservative.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m focusing on building <a href="https://www.pupilfirst.com">PupilFirst</a> - an LMS that my company open-sourced recently, and which we’ve been working on since 2013. It mixes Ruby, ReasonML &amp; GraphQL, and is probably one of the largest open-source ReasonReact webapps out there.</p>
