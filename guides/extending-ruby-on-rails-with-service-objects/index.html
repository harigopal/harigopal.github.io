    <p>Service objects are a pattern that I believe should be part of Rails’ default. This extends the basic MVC model by introducing services to implement business logic (instead of stuffing it into a model). While Rails’ default assumption that each model would hold its own business logic is <em>sound</em>, it doesn’t scale well when the application’s size increases.</p>

<p>There are a lot of articles suggesting patterns on where and how to store services. My approach is mostly the same, but with a few <em>upgrades</em>. This is what an example <code class="highlighter-rouge">app/services</code> folder might look like:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/c0b2ddb53f3b8e0d5875c00f33beda51.js"></script>

<p>The main thing to note here is that there are a few <em>conventions</em>, but no strict <em>rules</em>.</p>

<h2 id="one-or-few-responsibilities">One, or few responsibilities</h2>

<p>Naming plays a big role here - try to keep the name as specific as possible to avoid the temptation to <em>extend</em> the responsibility of a service object. So, instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Users::SlackService</code>, it might be a better idea to call it <code class="highlighter-rouge">Users::SendSlackMessageService</code>.</p>

<p>Unlike models, with their attached database tables, it’s cheap (zero cost, really) to create new services - spin new ones up whenever you encounter business logic that needs to be implemented.</p>

<h2 id="service-related-to-a-model">Service related to a model</h2>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/7ebffe156a8239ccac5d7d256adefb2c.js"></script>

<p>Services are grouped into a <em>pluralized-model-name</em> module when the action they perform is closely related to a model. This group is for the sake of organization - nothing more, so if a service does something that’s related to two models, you’ll have to make a call on which module it best fits into.</p>

<h2 id="-and-when-its-not-related-to-a-model">… and when it’s <em>not</em> related to a model</h2>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/5789ff9820bb7d86bd815654cd16c8b7.js"></script>

<p>Frequently, business logic may not tie in directly to <em>any</em> model. In this example, there’s a third-party service that the application needs to interact with, so the module its grouped under is simply the name of the service. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">execute</code> method is also replaced with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">posts</code> method to indicate that the service returns something, instead of simply performing an action.</p>

<h2 id="concerns-to-share-abilities">Concerns to share abilities</h2>

<p>Embrace Rails concerns when you encounter pieces of functionality that is useful in a number of situations - a common one is the ability to write to the log.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/2d9d7ffeedbb360f70381559dbcb7766.js"></script>

<p>Including this module into a service will allow it to easily write to the Rails log with additional information regarding the source of the message and a timestamp.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-easy-to-test">They’re easy to test</h2>

<p>Because these are plain Ruby classes, they’re generally easy to test. If you’ve stuck to the <em>Single-resposibility Principle</em>, the test cases should be pretty simple as well - writing a lot of small services pays off here.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’re working on a non-trivial project, services can be a massive boon. There’s definitely a <em>back-to-the-roots</em> feel to it, and that’s deliberate - Ruby is an expressive, easy-to-read language, and service objects are plain Ruby classes that describe all the little pieces that form the building blocks of your application.</p>

<p>I’ve heard it said that a someone looking through your <code class="highlighter-rouge">services</code> folder should get a fair idea of what your application <em>does</em>, and I think that’s an inevitable end-result if you write service objects properly.</p>
