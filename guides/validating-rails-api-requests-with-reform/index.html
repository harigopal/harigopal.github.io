  <h1>Validating Rails API requests with Reform</h1>
  <p>I’ve written about the creation of custom exception classes to organize code in Rails web applications and APIs. However, while going through my previous article, I realized that my final example glossed over how request parameter validation failures would be detected by the API in the first place.</p>

<p>Today I want to discuss a pattern that I haven’t seen in the wild - one which uses <em>Reform</em> - form objects, decoupled from models (their description) - and exception classes to <em>beautifully</em> manage API parameter validation.</p>

<h2 id="an-intro-to-form-objects-for-those-unfamiliar-with-it">An intro to form objects, for those unfamiliar with it.</h2>

<p>If you haven’t used form objects before, know that they allow you to decouple validation of input from the user (via forms), and the validation of data managed by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Model</code>. My primary reason for favoring this separation is that it allows the model validations to be less constrained than form validation.</p>

<p>Validations failures from a model should be <strong>unexpected</strong>, whereas form validations are always <strong>expected</strong> (users make mistakes) and thus should be handled as a natural part of your application. Decoupling in this manner also makes it easy to manage multiple forms that interact with one or more models, with different validation requirements. Google <code class="highlighter-rouge">form validation vs model validation</code> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="but-api-s-dont-have-forms-right">But API-s don’t <em>have</em> forms. Right?</h2>

<p>No, they don’t. What they do have are end-points where you <em>POST</em> data, and expect something about your application’s database to change. Such data needs to be validated. This article is going to focus on how to use <em>Reform</em> - a library meant for validating data submitted by <em>users</em> into <em>forms</em>, to validate data submitted by <em>clients</em> to <em>API endpoints</em>. <em>Clients</em> instead of <em>users</em>, and <em>API endpoints</em> instead of <em>forms</em>. Let’s begin.</p>

<h2 id="post-apiusersinvite">POST /api/users/invite</h2>

<p>Let’s assume that we need to implement a simple <em>invite</em> route for our API - to invite other users to join our platform. It accepts just two parameters:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code></li>
</ol>

<p>…and responds with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">200 OK</code> if the invitation can be processed.</p>

<p>However, as with all such requests, there are conditions which must be fulfilled before the request can be executed. Let’s list down three simple requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code> is required.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">email</code> must look like an email address.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> is optional, but if present, it must be longer than 3 characters.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last one is a bit contrived, but this is just a demonstration. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h2 id="create-a-reform-form">Create a Reform Form.</h2>

<p>Let’s get the basics out of the way. Setting up <em>Reform</em> should be pretty simple. Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem 'reform-rails', '~&gt; 0.1.7'</code> to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>, and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code>. That should be it. Now, let’s build our form object.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/1de28e963edeed26e9580fb00749e2a3.js"></script>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">reform-rails</code> allows you to write validations in much the same way that you’d write validations for regular Rails models. Granted that this is a very simple form, but even complex Reform forms are readable, and its API is rich and flexible.</p>

<p>If you’re confused by <code class="highlighter-rouge">email: true</code>, I’m assuming the presence of a custom Rails validator. For an example, check out <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#custom-validators">Rails’ documentation on adding custom validators</a>.</p>

<p>Note that I’m overriding the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> method, since I don’t want Reform touching the model. I advise keeping code handling the <em>actual</em> invitation out of the form. Our form is responsible for data validation, not operations. <a href="/guides/extending-ruby-on-rails-with-service-objects">Leave business logic to services.</a></p>

<h2 id="set-up-the-endpoint">Set up the endpoint.</h2>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/ec811f2bc3cf7e9f18006a3a3349c4dd.js"></script>

<p><em>Reform</em> requires explicit validation which, I think, reads better than the <em>Rails way</em>. Unlike Rails’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">if @user.save</code>, <em>Reform</em> asks the form object to validate the form with the supplied params, <em>and then</em> do something if the validation passes (or something else when it fails).</p>

<p>In this case, a failure to validate lets us raise <code class="highlighter-rouge">ValidationException</code>, passing it the form object. This is a custom exception which <a href="/guides/exceptions-as-first-class-citizens-on-rails">I’d elaborated on in a previous article</a>. Let’s take another look.</p>

<h2 id="validationfailureexception">ValidationFailureException</h2>

<p>I’m going to extend an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ApplicationException</code> class that I went into detail in my article on exception classes:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/ab851d1f2a0a8bb8a4a70409ad03c2b2.js"></script>

<p>Coupled with application level exception handling, as described in my previous post, if you <em>POST</em> to the API with invalid data, it responds with a lot of detail.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/1152bb382b07e8087ffea534e602f8e8.js"></script>

<p>Isn’t that beautiful?</p>

<p>Those validation errors can now be used by the client to display the failure to the user. Obviously, this needs to be set up only once. As long as you validate params with Reform, and pass the form with the errors to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ValidationFailureException</code> when raising it, responses in a standard format are taken care of.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Form objects are a great abstraction that allow us to deal with of the process of validating user input in one place. If you’re building an API for other developers or the public, good documentation is an absolute necessity. And while invalid form submissions showing users what’s wrong is commonplace, APIs doing something similar for their clients is <em>rare</em>.</p>

<p>Using Reform, it’s possible to give consumers of your API insights into what went wrong the same way a user entering incorrect information into a form is treated. Sure, once set up, an API client won’t make (the same) mistake again. But when integrating with a new API, a little help can go a long way.</p>
