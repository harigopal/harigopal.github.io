<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR?</h2>

<p>I’ve modified Jared Forsyth’s tutorial on ReasonReact, improving application state management. By sending two props, <code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">appSend</code> to all child components, we allow them influence shared state directly, instead of relying on a complex web of callbacks. Sound interesting?</p>

<h2 id="go-on">Go on…</h2>

<p>Want to implement shared state in <em>ReasonReact</em> applications..?</p>

<p>Probably not, if I’m being practical. The likelyhood of you, the reader, having even heard about <em>ReasonML</em>, let alone <em>ReasonReact</em>, is small. While <em>Reason</em> was featured in <a href="https://stateofjs.com/2017/flavors/results/"><em>theStateOfJs 2017</em></a>, ~80% of survey respondents said that they’d never heard of it. So if you haven’t, that’s totally OK. Head over to <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML’s homepage</a> right now, and give this new (sort of?) language a spin. It’s <strong>cool</strong>, it’s built by the folks behind React, and is backed by the might of OCaml.</p>

<p>However, if you’re among the ~19.2% who’ve heard about <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react">ReasonML</a>, or the ~0.8% who’ve actually tried it <strong>and</strong> wondered about how shared / global state can work, this tutorial is for <strong>you</strong>! All of the code I’ll refer to in this article is available <a href="http://github.com/harigopal/react-re-exp">on this repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-some-background">But first, some background</h2>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://jaredforsyth.com">Jared Forsyth</a> published <a href="https://jaredforsyth.com/2017/07/05/a-reason-react-tutorial/"><em>A ReasonReact Tutorial</em></a>, an excellent starting point for folks interested in building React applications with ReasonML. The tutorial involves building a simple Todo list app, using reducers to manage application state — a feature provided out-of-the-box by ReasonReact. The application structure looks <em>something</em> like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>App implements reducer(action)
  -&gt; TodoItem onToggle=send(Toggle)
  -&gt; TodoInput onSubmit=send(AddItem(text))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the application state is managed in the root component through a reducer, but child components can update application state only through callbacks that are passed down as props from <em>root</em>.</p>

<p>This process of passing callbacks to child components is clunky. In larger applications, where a child component can be distant from root, adding new callbacks can deteriorate into something that looks like a relay race. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>App implementes editCallback(), deleteCallback(), ...
  -&gt; TodoItem editCallback=editCallback deleteCallback=deleteCallback...
    -&gt; TodoInlineEditor editCallback=editCallback deleteCallback=deleteCallback...
      =&gt; Use editCallback()
      -&gt; TodoDeleteButton deleteCallback=deleteCallback
        =&gt; Use deleteCallback()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/turaku/image/upload/201802/callback_2.png" alt="The Callback Relay Race - Page 2" /></p>

<p><a href="#">Blair Anderson</a> wrote an excellent article titled <a href="https://medium.com/@blairanderson/you-probably-dont-need-redux-1b404204a07f">“You Probably Don’t Need Redux”</a> which explains how, in small-to-medium sized React applications, it’s often enough to pass two props — <code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">setAppState</code> to all components, allowing nested components direct access to the shared state, bypassing the need to add and <em>relay</em> individual callbacks.</p>

<p>My implementation of Jared’s tutorial mixes this idea in, and sends two props, <code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">appSend</code>, to all components that could influence shared state. For the sake of clarity, I’m only going to point out parts of the code that diverge from Jared’s tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="a-reasonable-alternative">A reasonable alternative</h2>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/974109e09597ac17ca71d09eb4000770.js"></script>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code> as the name indicates, is the shared state, stored by the root component. <code class="highlighter-rouge">appSend</code> is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">send</code> method made available to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render</code> method of the root component. We’re passing that alongside <code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code>, to allow child components to trigger the root component’s reducer. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">TodoForm</code> component doesn’t need the <code class="highlighter-rouge">appState</code> prop because it never reads shared state.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/978e4e5b08431bb420fdb7a9896ada12.js"></script>

<p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TodoItem</code> component uses the prop <code class="highlighter-rouge">appSend</code>, it passes an action <code class="highlighter-rouge">TodoApp.ToggleItem</code>. To correctly resolve the it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">type action</code>, we need to explicity mention the namespace — the shared module <code class="highlighter-rouge">TodoApp</code>. Since all components need access to the type definition of <em>state</em> and all possible <em>actions</em>, they <a href="https://github.com/harigopal/react-re-exp/blob/master/src/TodoApp.re">must be placed in this separate shared module</a>.</p>

<p>My first attempt at implementing this pattern kept the types <em>state</em> and <em>action</em> in the root component module. However, that just led to a circular dependency issue: <code class="highlighter-rouge">App -&gt; child -&gt; App</code>, blocking compilation. Extracting shared code to a different module fixed this.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much it. Notice how there are no callback functions anywhere?</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/turaku/image/upload/201802/callback_3.png" alt="The Callback Relay Race - Page 3" /></p>

<h2 id="advantages-and-a-few-caveats">Advantages, and a few caveats</h2>

<p>With ReasonReact, we’re using reducers by default, so code that updates shared state is brought into the same module. Child components can now only <em>trigger</em> changes to shared state while the nature of the state change is strictly controlled by the reducer (which should be a pure function). This makes it much easier to control and ensure correctness of shared state.</p>

<p>And given that we’re using a language with a strong, inferred, and most importantly, <em>sound</em> type system, we get all of its benefits as well.</p>

<p>One thing that I’m not <em>totally</em> happy with is that I was forced to <code class="highlighter-rouge">open TodoApp</code> (first line in <code class="highlighter-rouge">App.re</code> gist above) within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">App</code> module. TodoApp defines the <code class="highlighter-rouge">state</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">action</code> types that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">App</code> component relies on, and I kept running into syntax errors when I tried to annotate types. All the other modules have manual type annotation when they first refer to either the shared <code class="highlighter-rouge">state</code> or an <code class="highlighter-rouge">action</code>. <em>Opening</em> TodoApp in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">App</code> module isn’t a big issue though, since it’s the root component.</p>

<p>Re-visiting the earlier contrived example with our new pattern, we end up with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>TodoApp implements state and action types, and the reducer.

App uses TodoApp.state, TodoApp.action and TodoApp.reducer
  -&gt; TodoItem appState=App.state appSend=App.send
    -&gt; TodoInlineEditor appState=App.state appSend=App.send
      =&gt; props.appSend(TodoApp.Edit(todoId, text))
      -&gt; TodoDeleteButton appSend=App.send
        =&gt; props.appSend(TodoApp.Delete(todoId))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think this is a clearer, and more consise approach than callback-passing. There’s no need to add more <em>batons</em> to the relay race either, when new actions need to be handled.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’ve been working on a personal project, <a href="https://www.turaku.com">Turaku</a> - a password manager for teams, with ES6 + React, for the past couple of months, and its increasing complexity meant that the pain of refactoring and adding new features was slowly increasing from <em>mere annoyance</em> to <em>stinging</em>. In my search for a more <em>robust</em> environment, I was drifting towards Typescript when <a href="#">Jasim</a> and <a href="#">Sherin</a> of <a href="#">Protoship.io</a> suggested ReasonML as a (better) alternative.</p>

<p>While I’m still getting used to ReasonML and ReasonReact, my initial impressions have been generally positive. Both the language and the library are evolving rapidly at the moment. For example, while I was working through Jared’s tutorial and trying to adapt it to my preferences, ReasonReact updated and replaced the <code class="highlighter-rouge">self.reduce</code> method with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">self.send</code> method which is much easier to comprehend and use.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/harigopal/89cddfb3ce8f0b74cfc484e2529070c0.js"></script>

<p>The ReasonML compiler error messages can be pretty confusing at times though. And all too often, it just barks that there’s <em>something</em> wrong with my syntax on a line, informs me that it crashed because of this, and asks me to file a bug on Reason’s repository. <code class="highlighter-rouge">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code> Growing pains, I guess.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of months, I’ll attempt a complete re-write of Turaku’s code into ReasonML. I’d been using <code class="highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code>, so the presence of <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts">reason-scripts</a> makes it simple to get started. I’m sure I’ll be writing more related to this on a later date. :-)</p>
